1- //create objects
ClassName objectName = new ConstructorName();
for example:
Student st = new Student();
//Student is the class name
//st is the object name
//new means initilizating the first time
//Student means constructor

2- //Inheritance
Means Child class inherit from parent class or Sub class inherit from Super class
for example:
public class FullTimeEmployee extends Employee;
//public class means it is a publicly accessible class
//FullTimeEmployee is a developer given name for a child class
// extends means inheritance is taking place
//Employee is the parent class

3- //Constructors
//We have basically two types, one is defualt and other is parametrized
//constructors will build the class at run time
for example:
public class Employee
{
//varibales
int emp_id;
//parametrized constructor
public Employee(int e_id)
{
this.emp_id = e_id;
//e_id is the value passing from brackets as parameters
//emp_id is the class variable
//this. is a reference given to class variable
//so here we pass values from brackets to class variables
}
}

4- Method overloading
//means using two or more methods with same name in the same class
//for example constructor is also a method where i keep two constructors means
i am overloading the methods as in the same class

5- Method Overriding
//means using two more methods with same name but different class
//also the paramters may be different (in brackets)
//for example display method in super class has been modified and used in child class
